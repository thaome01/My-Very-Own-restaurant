<h2>Flagship Location - Lily Avenue</h2>

<p>
    This location means alot to me. My main reason of why I opened this shop on Lily Avenue because this is where I met my wife. 
    Without my wife, I wouldn't be able to accomplish my goals! She was there when I had my up and downs, she continue to encourage me to follow greatness.
    Thanks to my beautiful wife who never gavev up on me.
